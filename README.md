# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable
### Step 3: 
Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable.
### Step 4: 
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable
### Step 5: 
End The program
### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
x1,y1=4,2
x2,y2=10,6
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")
```  


### OUTPUT:
